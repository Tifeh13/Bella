      <div class="bio-text">
        <p><strong>Bella</strong> is a 24-year-old contemporary artist with a passion for capturing movement, rhythm, and story through her paintings. Her work explores intersections between music, sports, fashion, and human emotion, creating pieces that resonate with energy and authenticity.</p>

        <h3>Artistic Vision & Ideas</h3>
        <p>Bella approaches every commission with a strong conceptual foundation. Her ideas often stem from listening to music, observing athletic performance, or reflecting on cultural moments. This allows her to create artworks that feel alive — with texture, movement, and color harmoniously conveying a narrative. Each piece is designed to evoke emotion, spark curiosity, and leave a lasting impression.</p>

        <h3>Collaborations & Notable Works</h3>
        <p>Over the years, Bella has worked with a range of artists, brands, and institutions, producing work for album covers, sports arenas, and international exhibitions. Some highlights include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collaborative mural inspired by <em>Beyoncé</em>’s music videos.</li>
          <li>Portrait series capturing the essence of <em>Lionel Messi</em> and <em>Serena Williams</em> in motion.</li>
          <li>Fashion-forward illustrations commissioned by creatives inspired by <em>Virgil Abloh</em> and <em>Rihanna</em>.</li>
          <li>Digital paintings for campaigns with music labels and cultural festivals across Europe and Africa.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mediums & Techniques</h3>
        <p>Bella works across both traditional and digital mediums, blending oil, acrylic, and ink with digital textures and layering techniques. Her versatility allows her to produce murals, prints, album visuals, and bespoke commissions. She emphasizes experimentation — combining brushwork with digital effects to achieve depth, contrast, and emotion in every piece.</p>

        <h3>Philosophy & Creative Impact</h3>
        <p>Her art reflects the pulse of contemporary culture. Through every stroke, Bella channels rhythm from music, motion from sports, and narratives from everyday life. She believes art should connect communities, provoke thought, and inspire creativity — leaving a lasting cultural impact.</p>
