      <div class="bio-text">
        <p><strong>I am Bella</strong>, a dedicated oil painting artist known for transforming blank canvases into expressive, timeless works of art. Over the years, I have refined my skills in layering, glazing, and blending techniques that give each painting depth, richness, and emotion.</p>

        <h3>Oil Painting Vision</h3>
        <p>My artistic philosophy is rooted in the belief that oil painting is more than technique — it is a conversation between texture, color, and emotion. Each stroke is intentional, every layer adds history, and the finished canvas captures a story that resonates beyond the surface.</p>

        <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
        <p>I have studied, collaborated, and worked alongside seasoned oil painting masters, gaining first-hand insight into classical and contemporary methods. This experience has shaped me into an artist who bridges traditional craftsmanship with modern storytelling through oil on canvas.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Worked on commissioned oil portraits and large-scale canvases for private collectors.</li>
          <li>Trained with and assisted top oil painting professionals on collaborative projects.</li>
          <li>Exhibited works that highlight mastery of light, shadow, and layered brushwork.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mediums & Techniques</h3>
        <p>My expertise lies primarily in oil on canvas, with a focus on portraiture and expressive compositions. I combine classic underpainting, glazing, and impasto techniques to create works that feel alive — rich in texture, depth, and detail. Every project is crafted to withstand time, maintaining the traditional power of oil painting.</p>

        <h3>Philosophy & Impact</h3>
        <p>Oil painting is timeless — a medium that connects past masters with today’s creative visionaries. My goal is to carry that legacy forward, producing works that are both deeply personal and universally relatable. Through my canvases, I aim to inspire, preserve tradition, and leave an imprint in the world of fine art.</p>
